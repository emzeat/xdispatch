_This project is no longer actively maintained. While it should be functional
in general, the codebase will not receive any bugfixes moving forward. You might want to have a look at the successor project
[xdispatch2](https://github.com/emzeat/xdispatch2) though._

xdispatch
=================

XDispatch provides the power of Grand Central Dispatch not only on Mac OS 10.6+
but also on Windows and Linux. The XDispatch framework consists of three libraries:
 * libdispatch
 * libxdispatch
 * libqtdispatch

Feel free to fork it and change it as you like. We always welcome any bugfixes or
improvements to our current code base.
